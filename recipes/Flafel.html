    <h1>Best Falafel</h1>
    <img src="/media/falafel.jpg" alt="Falafel">
    <p>Sure, you can make falafel from a mix but frankly,<br>
        it's a far cry from authentic falafel. This is the<br>
        best falafel recipe I know of. You can find dried<br>
        fava beans in Middle Eastern grocery stores and some<br>
        supermarkets. Serve with pita bread, tahini sauce,<br>
        lettuce, and other chopped vegetables.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried fava beans</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves removed</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place fava beans in a bowl and cover with plenty of cold water. Soak for 2 days, changing the water daily (in hot weather change the water twice daily).</li>
        <li>Soak chickpeas on the second day in a separate bowl in plenty of cold water.</li>
        <li>Drain beans and chickpeas and rinse under cold running water; drain again. Remove the skins from the fava beans and discard them. Do not skip that step or the falafel will not taste good.</li>
        <li>Combine fava beans, chickpeas, onion, garlic, and parsley leaves in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until pureed, scraping the sides often to ensure everything is evenly processed to a smooth paste. Add cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, baking soda, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a bowl; cover and let mixture rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet or a large tray with waxed paper.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into 25 to 30 evenly sized patties and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1/2 inch between them. Let rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour oil into the bottom of a large skillet until it just covers the bottom. Heat until oil is hot enough to sizzle a breadcrumb.</li>
        <li>Carefully lift the falafel from the waxed paper using a spatula. Fry a few falafel at a time and do not overcrowd the skillet. Fry until crisp and brown on the underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and fry on the other side until browned, another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and transfer to a baking sheet. Place the finished falafel in the preheated oven to keep warm while you fry the rest, adding more oil to the pan as needed.</li>
    </ol>
